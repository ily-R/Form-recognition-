Calculation of Legendre Moments for each image and storing them as .txt files in a data-base.
-For each image the user inputs the program calculates its Legendre Moments and compares it to the data-base.
-the program Outputs the image in the data-base with the least Euclidien Distance to the input image with respect to their Legendre moments matrices.
-a very memory efficient program, using C programming language, memory allocation and pointers destruction, Legendre moments stored in triangular allocated 2D arrays, the program is dynamic for different degrees of Legendre Coefficients and it is adaptable to larger data-bases.
